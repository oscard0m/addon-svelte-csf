<Meta title="Examples/ExportName" name="MDX Docs" />

This document demonstrates how to import stories in other files, such as MDX docs.

Stories are imported by using their export name, either derived from their `name` prop or the explicit `exportName` prop.

The following "Simple name" story is added like this:

```mdx
import * as ExportNameStories from './ExportName.stories.svelte';
...
<Canvas of={ExportNameStories.SimpleName} />
```

<Canvas of={ExportNameStories.SimpleName} />

The following story with a custom export name is added like this:

```mdx
import * as ExportNameStories from './ExportName.stories.svelte';
...
<Canvas of={ExportNameStories.CustomExportName} />
```

<Canvas of={ExportNameStories.CustomExportName} />
